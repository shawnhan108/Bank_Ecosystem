# Bank_Ecosystem

This is an experimental project where we created a bank ecosystem focused around three primary functions:
  1) Ease of Use;
  2) Optimized Performance; and
  3) Data Analytics.

This is a full-stack development project. It includes a back-end developmeent portion in Python, a front-end development portion in Tableau as well as a database management portion in MySQL. The entire datapipline was engineered on essential object-oriented programming principles that emphasis abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in our code structure.

We captured the functionality of a regular banking application, like those found in RBC, Scotiabank, TD Bank, BMO, and CIBC. In addition, we included our own analytics to provide deeper insight for commercial and personal banking on an individual basis.

This project is a collaboration between Anshul Kapoor and Yushuo (Shawn) Han.
